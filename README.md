# QR-Component<br>
A Frontend Mentor Challenge<br>
The QR Component coding challenge requires that I build a design of QR code component provided on the challenge hub and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<br>
To achieve this, I simply used HTML and CSS. It is not responsive so it is best viewed on a laptop or large screen.<br>
Attached also is a jpg file of what the design for the challenge looks like thus, you can check it out.<br>

Happy Viewing!
