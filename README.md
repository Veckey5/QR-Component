# QR-Component
A Frontend Mentor Challenge
The QR Component coding challenge requires that I build a design of QR code component provided on the challenge hub and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
To achieve this, I simply used HTML and CSS. It is not responsive so it is best viewed on a laptop or large screen.
